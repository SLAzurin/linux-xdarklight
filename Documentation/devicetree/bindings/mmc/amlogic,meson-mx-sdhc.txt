* Amlogic Meson6, Meson8, Meson8b and Meson8m2 SDHC controller

The SDHC MMC host controller on Amlogic SoCs provides an eMMC and MMC
card interface with 1/4/8-bit bus width.
It supports eMMC spec 4.4x/4.5x including HS200 (up to 100MHz clock).

This file documents the properties in addition to those available in
the MMC core bindings, documented by mmc.txt.

Required properties:
 - compatible : must be one of
	- "amlogic,meson8-sdhc"
	- "amlogic,meson8b-sdhc"
	- "amlogic,meson8m2-sdhc"
	preceded by the generic "amlogic,meson-mx-sdhc"
 - reg : register base address and size
 - interrupts : SDHC controller interrupt
 - clocks : phandle to clock providers
 - clock-names : "pclk", "clkin0", "clkin1", "clkin2" and "clkin3"
		 ("pclk" is the module gate clock, and clkin are
		  the inputs to the internal clock mux)

Examples:
	mmc@8e00 {
		compatible = "amlogic,meson8-sdhc", "amlogic,meson-mx-sdhc";
		reg = <0x8e00 0x42>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 78 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
		clocks = <&clkc CLKID_SDHC>,
			<&clkc CLKID_XTAL>,
			<&clkc CLKID_FCLK_DIV4>,
			<&clkc CLKID_FCLK_DIV3>,
			<&clkc CLKID_FCLK_DIV5>;
		clock-names = "pclk", "clkin0", "clkin1", "clkin2", "clkin3";
	};
