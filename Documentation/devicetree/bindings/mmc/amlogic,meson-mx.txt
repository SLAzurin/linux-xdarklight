* Amlogic Meson8 and Meson8b MMC controller

The highspeed MMC host controller on Amlogic SoCs provides an interface
for MMC, SD, SDIO and SDHC types of memory cards.

Supported maximum speeds are the ones of the eMMC standard 4.41 as well
as the speed of SD standard 2.0.

The hardware provides an internal "mux" which allows up to three slots
to be controlled. Only one device can be accessed at a time.

Required properties:
 - compatible : must be one of
	- "amlogic,meson8-mmc"
	- "amlogic,meson8b-mmc"
	along with the generic "amlogic,meson-mx-mmc"
 - reg : mmc controller base registers
 - interrupts : mmc controller interrupt
 - #address-cells : must be 1
 - size-cells : must be 0
 - clocks : phandle to clock providers
 - clock-names : must contain "core" and "clkin"

Required child nodes:
A node for each slot provided by the MMC controller is required.

Required properties on each child node (= slot):
 - pinctrl-n : phandles to the active and idle pin states
 - pinctrl-names : must contain "active" and "idle"

Optional properties on each child node (= slot):
 - for cd, bus-width and additional generic mmc parameters
   please refer to mmc.txt within this directory

Examples:
	mmc0: mmc@c1108c20 {
		compatible = "amlogic,meson8-mmc", "amlogic,meson-mx-mmc";
		reg = <0xc1108c20 0x20>;
		interrupts = <0 28 1>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		clocks = <&clkc CLKID_SDIO>, <&clkc CLKID_CLK81>;
		clock-names = "core", "clkin";

		slot@1 {
			reg = <1>;

			pinctrl-0 = <>;
			pinctrl-1 = <&mmc0_sd_b_pins>;
			pinctrl-names = "default", "active";
		};
	};
