* Clock bindings for the CGU (Clock Generation Unit) on Lantiq XWAY SoCs

Required properties:
- compatible:	Has to be one of the following
	- "lantiq,arx100-cgu"
	- "lantiq,arx300-cgu"
	- "lantiq,ase-cgu"
	- "lantiq,danube-cgu"
	- "lantiq,grx390-cgu"
	- "lantiq,vrx200-cgu"
	- "lantiq,cgu-xway" (deprecated, should not be used anymore)
- reg:		Address and length of the register set
- #clock-cells:	Should be <1>

Optional properties:
- lantiq,gphy-clk-select:	Defines the clock-source for the internal GPHY
				clock. All available values are defined as
				preprocessor macros (CGU_GPHY_CLK_*) in
				include/dt-bindings/clock/lantiq-xway-cgu.h

Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes can use this identifier
to specify the clock which they consume. All available clocks are defined as
preprocessor macros in the include/dt-bindings/clock/lantiq-xway-cgu.h
header and can be used in device tree sources.
