* Clock bindings for the clocks found on on Lantiq Falcon SoCs

Required properties:
- compatible:	Has to be one of the following
	- "lantiq,sys1-falcon"
	- "lantiq,syseth-falcon"
- reg:		Address and length of the register set
- #clock-cells:	Should be <1>

Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes can use this identifier
to specify the clock which they consume. All available clocks are defined as
preprocessor macros in the include/dt-bindings/clock/lantiq-falcon.h
header and can be used in device tree sources.
