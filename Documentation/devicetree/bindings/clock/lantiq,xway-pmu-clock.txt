* Clock bindings for the PMU (Power Management Unit) gates on Lantiq XWAY SoCs

Required properties:
- compatible:	Has to be one of the following
	- "lantiq,arx300-pmu"
	- "antiq,ase-pmu"
	- "lantiq,danube-pmu"
	- "lantiq,grx300-pmu"
	- "lantiq,xrx100-pmu"
	- "lantiq,xrx200-pmu"
	- "lantiq,pmu-xway" (deprecated, should not be used anymore)
- reg:		Address and length of the register set
- #clock-cells:	Should be <1>

Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes can use this identifier
to specify the clock which they consume. All available clocks are defined as
preprocessor macros in the following (SoC specific) headers and can be used in
device tree sources:
	- include/dt-bindings/clock/lantiq-pmu-arx300.h
	- include/dt-bindings/clock/lantiq-pmu-ase.h
	- include/dt-bindings/clock/lantiq-pmu-danube.h
	- include/dt-bindings/clock/lantiq-pmu-grx300.h
	- include/dt-bindings/clock/lantiq-pmu-xrx200.h
	- include/dt-bindings/clock/lantiq-pmu-xrx100.h
