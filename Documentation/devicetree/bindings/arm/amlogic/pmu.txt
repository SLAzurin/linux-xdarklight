Amlogic Meson8 and Meson8b power-management-unit:
-------------------------------------------------

The pmu is used to turn off and on different power domains of the SoCs
This configures the power and isolation of various components such as
the CPU cores, video decoders and the HDMI controller.

Required node properties:
- compatible value : depending on the SoC this should be one of:
			"amlogic,meson8-pmu"
			"amlogic,meson8b-pmu"
- reg : physical base address and the size of the registers window
- #power-domain-cells : must be 1

Example:

	pmu@c81000e4 {
		compatible = "amlogic,meson8b-pmu", "syscon";
		reg = <0xc81000e0 0x18>;
		#power-domain-cells = <1>;
	};
