* Lantiq PCI express root complex


Required properties:
- compatible:	must be "lantiq,<soc-model>-pcie", "snps,dw-pcie"
		where soc-model is xrx200
- reg:	the DesignWare PCIe controller's dbi registers, the PCI config space
	and the PCIe controller application registers, see designware-pcie.txt
- reg-names:	must contain "dbi", "config" and "app", see designware-pcie.txt
- ranges:	ranges for the PCI memory and I/O regions
		see designware-pcie.txt
- interrupts:	the PCIe application and MSI interrupt lines
- interrupt-names:	must contain "app" and "msi"
- lantiq,rcu:	a phandle to the RCU syscon
- resets:	must contain a phandle to the PCIe reset line which is shared
		between the PCIe core and the PCIe PHY
- clocks:	must contain a phandle to the PCIe core and bus clocks
- clock-names:	must contain "pcie", "pcie_bus" and "ahb"
		see designware-pcie.txt
- phys:		must contain a phandle to the PCIe PHY
- phy-names:	must be "pcie"
- #address-cells:	set to <3>, see designware-pcie.txt
- #size-cells:	set to <2>, see designware-pcie.txt
- device_type:	set to "pci", see designware-pcie.txt
- #interrupt-cells:	set to <1>, see designware-pcie.txt
- interrupt-map-mask and interrupt-map:	see designware-pcie.txt

Optional properties:
- num-lanes:	number of lanes to use, see designware-pcie.txt
- reset-gpios:	phandle to the reset GPIO, see designware-pcie.txt
- big-endian:		configure the PCIe AHB slave as big-endian
- little-endian:	configure the PCIe AHB slave as little-endian
