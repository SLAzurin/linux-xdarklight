* Qualcomm Atheros ath9k wireless devices

This node provides properties for configuring the ath9k wireless device. The
node is expected to be specified as a child node of the PCI controller to
which the wireless chip is connected.

Required properties:
- compatible: For PCI and PCIe devices this should be an identifier following
		the format as defined in "PCI Bus Binding to Open Firmware"
		Revision 2.1. One of the possible formats is "pciVVVV,DDDD"
		where VVVV is the PCI vendor ID and DDDD is PCI device ID.
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device.

Optional properties:
- qca,no-eeprom: Indicates that there is no physical EEPROM connected to the
			ath9k wireless chip (in this case the calibration /
			EEPROM data will be loaded from userspace using the
			kernel firmware loader).
- mac-address: See ethernet.txt in the parent directory
- local-mac-address: See ethernet.txt in the parent directory


In this example, the node is defined as child node of the PCI controller:
&pci0 {
	ath9k@168c,002d {
		compatible = "pci168c,002d";
		reg = <0x7000 0 0 0 0x1000>;
		qca,no-eeprom;
	};
};
