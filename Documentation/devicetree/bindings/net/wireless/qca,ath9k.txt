* Qualcomm Atheros ath9k wireless devices

This node provides properties for configuring the ath9k wireless device. The
node is expected to be specified as a child node of the PCI controller to
which the wireless chip is connected.

Required properties:
- compatible: For PCI and PCIe devices this should be an identifier following
		the format as defined in "PCI Bus Binding to Open Firmware"
		Revision 2.1. One of the possible formats is "pciVVVV,DDDD"
		where VVVV is the PCI vendor ID and DDDD is PCI device ID.
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device.

Optional properties:
- qca,no-eeprom: Indicates that there is no physical EEPROM connected to the
			ath9k wireless chip (in this case the calibration /
			EEPROM data will be loaded from userspace using the
			kernel firmware loader).
- qca,check-eeprom-endianness: When enabled, the driver checks if the
				endianness of the EEPROM (using two checks,
				one is based on the two magic bytes at the
				start of the EEPROM and a second one which
				relies on a flag within the EEPROM data)
				matches the host system's native endianness.
				The data will be swapped accordingly if there
				is a mismatch.
				Leaving this disabled means that the EEPROM
				data will always be interpreted in the
				system's native endianness.
				Enable this option only when the EEPROMs
				endianness identifiers are known to be
				correct, because otherwise the EEPROM data
				may be swapped and thus interpreted
				incorrectly.

In this example, the node is defined as child node of the PCI controller:
&pci0 {
	ath9k@168c,002d {
		compatible = "pci168c,002d";
		reg = <0x7000 0 0 0 0x1000>;
		qca,no-eeprom;
	};
};
