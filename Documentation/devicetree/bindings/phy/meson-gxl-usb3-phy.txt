* Amlogic Meson GXL and GXM USB3 PHY binding

Required properties:
- compatible:	Should be "amlogic,meson-gxl-usb3-phy"
- reg:		The base address and length of the registers
- #phys-cells:	should be 0 (see phy-bindings.txt in this directory)
- interrupts:	describes the OTG device/host mode detection interrupt

Optional properties:
- phys:		the related USB2 PHY whose mode will be controlled by
		this USB3 PHY in case the USB2 PHY does not have OTG
		host/device mode detection support. see
		phy-bindings.txt in this directory
- phy-names:	must be "usb2-phy" when a USB2 PHY is configured, see
		phy-bindings.txt in this directory
- phy-supply:	see phy-bindings.txt in this directory


Example:
	usb3_phy0: phy@78080 {
		compatible = "amlogic,meson-gxl-usb3-phy";
		#phy-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0x0 0x78080 0x0 0x20>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 16 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		phys = <&usb2_phys 0>, <&usb2_phys 1>;
	};
