* Amlogic Meson GXL and GXM USB3 PHY and OTG detection binding

Required properties:
- compatible:	Should be "amlogic,meson-gxl-usb3-phy"
- reg:		The base address and length of the registers
- #phys-cells:	must be 0 (see phy-bindings.txt in this directory)
- interrupts:	describes the OTG device/host mode detection interrupt

Optional properties:
- phys:		the USB2 PHY whose mode will be controlled by the OTG
		detection logic of the USB3 PHY, see phy-bindings.txt
		in this directory
- phy-names:	must be "usb2-phy" when a USB2 PHY is configured, see
		phy-bindings.txt in this directory
- phy-supply:	see phy-bindings.txt in this directory


Example:
	usb3_phy0: phy@78080 {
		compatible = "amlogic,meson-gxl-usb3-phy";
		#phy-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0x0 0x78080 0x0 0x20>;
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 16 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
		phys = <&usb2_phy0>;
		phy-names = "usb2-phy";
	};
