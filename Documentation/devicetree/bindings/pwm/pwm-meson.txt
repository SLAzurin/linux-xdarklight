Amlogic Meson PWM Controller
============================

Required properties:
- compatible: Depending on the SoC, this should be one of:
	- "amlogic,meson8-pwm" on Meson8 SoCs
	- "amlogic,meson8b-pwm" on Meson8b SoCs
	- "amlogic,meson8m2-pwm" on Meson8m2 SoCs
	- "amlogic,meson-gxbb-pwm" on Meson GXBB SoCs
- #pwm-cells: Should be 3. See pwm.txt in this directory for a description of
  the cells format.

Optional properties:
- clocks: Could contain one or two parents clocks phandle for each of the two
  PWM channels.
- clock-names: Could contain at least the "clkin0" and/or "clkin1" names.

Example:

	pwm_ab: pwm@8550 {
		compatible = "amlogic,meson-gxbb-pwm";
		reg = <0x0 0x08550 0x0 0x10>;
		#pwm-cells = <3>;
		status = "disabled";
		clocks = <&xtal>, <&xtal>;
		clock-names = "clkin0", "clkin1";
	}
