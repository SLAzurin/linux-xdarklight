* Reset controller for Lantiq XWAY SoCs

Please also refer to reset.txt in this directory for common reset
controller binding usage.

The reset controller node must be a sub-node of the sram node on XWAY SoCs.

Required properties:
- compatible: Must be one of the following:
	- "lantiq,rcu-xway" (for pre-xRX200 SoCs)
	- "lantiq,rcu-xrx200" (for xRX200 and newer SoCs)
- reg: Address and length of the register set
- #reset-cells: must be set to 2

Example:

rcu: rcu@203000 {
	compatible = "lantiq,rcu-xway";
	reg = <0x203000 0x1000>;
	#reset-cells = <2>;
};

usb0_phy1 {
	/* RCU offset 0x38 bit 0 and offset 0x18 bit 11: */
	resets = <&rcu 0x38 0>, <&rcu 0x18 11>;
}
